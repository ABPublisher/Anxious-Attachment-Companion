<h2>Data We Collect</h2>

<p>We do not have access to your personal entries.</p>

<h2>Local Data Storage</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Daily mood and anxiety check-ins</li>
    <li>Journal entries</li>
    <li>Calm session notes and ratings</li>
    <li>Premium entitlement status (stored locally after purchase or restore)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you uninstall the App, this locally stored data may be permanently deleted.</p>

<h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
<p>The App offers a one-time premium unlock through Google Play Billing.</p>

<p>All payments are processed securely by Google Play. We do not collect or store your payment information.</p>

<p>Google may collect and process payment data according to its own Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>

    <li>Tracking technologies</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.</p>

<p>Because all journal and check-in data is stored locally on your device, it is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

<h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>Since all personal content is stored locally on your device, the security of your data depends on your device’s security settings.</p>

<p>We recommend using device-level protections such as screen locks or biometric authentication.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
