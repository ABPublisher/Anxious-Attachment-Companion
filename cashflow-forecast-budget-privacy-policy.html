  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    If you choose to purchase a premium subscription, payment processing is handled securely by Google Play.
  </p>
  <p>
    The App does not collect or store your credit card details. Subscription status information may be received from Google Play to unlock premium features.

  <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>All financial data entered into Cashflow Forecast Budget is stored locally on your device.</p>
  <p>The developer does not collect, store, transmit, or have access to your financial records.</p>
  <p>The App does not use remote servers to store personal financial data in the current version.</p>
  <p>
    While the App is designed with reasonable security measures, you are responsible for securing your device with appropriate protections such as a device passcode or biometric authentication.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you uninstall the App, locally stored data may be permanently deleted unless backed up by your device’s operating system.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Cashflow Forecast Budget does not sell, rent, or share your personal financial information with third parties.</p>
  <p>Because financial data is stored locally on your device, it is not transmitted to the developer.</p>
  <p>
    The only third-party service involved in the App is Google Play, which may process subscription payments if you choose to purchase premium features.
    Google Play handles payment information in accordance with its own Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>The App does not use advertising networks and does not share financial data with analytics providers in the current version.</p>

  <hr />

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    Because Cashflow Forecast Budget stores financial data locally on your device, the App does not retain copies of your financial records on external servers.

  <ul>
    <li>You manually delete it within the App (if applicable), or</li>
    <li>You uninstall the App from your device.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Uninstalling the App may permanently remove locally stored data unless your device operating system performs its own backup.
  </p>
  <p>The developer does not maintain independent backups of your financial data.</p>

  <hr />

  <hr />

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Cashflow Forecast Budget is not directed toward children under the age of 13.</p>
  <p>
    The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because all financial data is stored locally on the user’s device and not transmitted to the developer, the developer does not have access to user-entered data.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you believe a child has provided personal information within the App, you may uninstall the App to remove locally stored data.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <hr />

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>The developer may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
